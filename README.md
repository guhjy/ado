rstata
==========

An interpreter for Stata's ado language built on top of R, currently under development.

Loops, macros, data manipulation commands and statistics commands are all
supported, as are multiple ways to embed R code and use R for writing ado-
language commands. (The language this package implements has about the same
relationship to Stata that various dialects of SQL have to each other.)

This package is not in any way affiliated with or endorsed by StataCorp.
