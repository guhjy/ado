Roadmap to v0.1:
Immediate TODO:
    o) expand the grammar to include
        o) formats
        o) data types
        o) fully general varlists
    o) error recovery + error if other character given
    o) make sure the location tracking works
    o) memory leaks
        o) delete the random string tokens that don't become part of the AST
        o) what about memory leaks during the error recovery stuff?
    
    o) infrastructural R functions - AST walkers, name abbreviation support, etc

Semantics:
    o) write up stubs for the initial 9 commands
    o) Stata-like output: how much is this worth imitating?

Write a test suite and test

Later functionality
    v0.2:
        o) A mechanism for the user to register an R function obeying the
           calling convention as a Stata command
        
        o) A batch processing mode
    
        o) Many more commands
            o) data management: egen, input, label, etc
            o) graphics
            o) basic stats
    
    v0.3:
        o) Loops + Macros

Write documentation
    o) man entries, vignettes, examples
    o) document the R expression format the parser emits
