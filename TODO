Immediate TODO:
    o) Macros, without loops
        o) not terribly hard - just need to find a way to lex nested macros and
           substitute their values from the symbol table
        o) "compound double quotes"
        o) commands to manipulate macros

        o) the driver's two callbacks make this fairly easy to implement

    o) semantic analysis and infrastructural R functions
        o) do signalCondition and friends behave the way I think?
        o) weeding for each type of node
        o) AST walkers to construct unevaluated calls and expression objects
            o) name abbreviation
        o) how much of the common weeding and walking can be encapsulated into
           superclass methods? use NextMethod
    
    o) functions for the initial set of commands
    
Later functionality
    o) Loops
        o) much harder, because of macros
    
    o) Many more commands
        o) data management: egen, input, label, etc
        o) graphics
        o) basic stats
        
Debug:
    o) use testthat and travis
    o) write a unit test suite
    o) test, test, test...

Write documentation
    o) man entries, vignettes, examples
    o) document the R expression format the parser emits

Wishlist functionality:
    o) A mechanism for the user to register an R function obeying the
       calling convention as a Stata command
    
    o) time-series operations and grammar

    o) very Stata-like output: unlikely to be worth imitating
