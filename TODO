Now:
  o) function and option args should be separable by ',' or ' '
    o) does this require a GLR parser?

  o) Macro substitution and compound double quotes
    o) the `=expr' syntax? can we just send this to R for evaluation as a string? need to check it if so

  o) syntax for weird commands
    o) does all this require a GLR parser?

    o) recode - define a varlist in the grammar and allow it as the LHS of an assignment
    o) ivregress - probably the same as with recode; the last expression_list member should be an
       assignment, optionally parenthesized, required to be parenthesized for non-ambiguity if LHS has
       more than one var
    o) collapse - just parse it as a varlist but interpret the "stats" differently; parens become optional
        o) if you want to use a stat as a varname, just give the target=varname form
    o) gsort - or need an algorithm to turn a parse tree of vars, + and - into a list of two-element pairs
    o) lrtest
    o) test
    o) anova

    o) fill out their function signatures

Backend:
  o) infrastructural R functions
    o) for prefix commands - quietly, noisily, capture, by, bysort, xi
    o) varlist_to_formula
    o) for operators - how many of these even need to exist?

  o) R functions for initial general commands

  o) Stata's "stored results"
    o) creturn

  o) complete all the commands which now have stubs

Frontend:
  o) Loops: much harder, because of macros

===============================================================================
Systematic debugging:
  o) use testthat and travis
  o) write a unit test suite
  o) test, test, test...

Documentation:
  o) document package object and rstata()
  o) update README
  o) long vignette: comprehensive
  o) short vignette: summary + differences from Stata
  o) document the R expression format the parser emits

Misc:
  o) figure out the NAMESPACE and what you have to export
  o) clean up gitignore and Rbuildignore
  o) Makevars and Makefile have to come from a configure script for
     portability - autoconf?

===============================================================================
Wishlist functionality:
  o) the way it stores ado command history is a godawful hack, probably
     also a race condition, and is Unix-specific

  o) A mechanism for the user to register an R function obeying the
     calling convention as a Stata command, persistently

  o) graphics
