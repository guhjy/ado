Roadmap to v0.1:
Immediate TODO:
    o) misc small parser fixes
        o) delete the random strings that don't become part of the AST,
           to avoid a memory leak
        o) make sure the location tracking works
        o) what about memory leaks during the error recovery stuff?
    o) infrastructural R functions - AST walkers, name abbreviation support, etc

Semantics:
    o) write up stubs for the R functions implementing Stata commands
    o) Stata-like output: how much is this worth imitating?

Write a test suite and test

* Edit the exports in 'NAMESPACE', and add necessary imports.
* Run R CMD build to build the package tarball.
* Run R CMD check to check the package tarball.

Later functionality
    v0.2:
        o) A mechanism for the user to register an R function obeying the
           calling convention as a Stata command
        
        o) A batch processing mode
    
        o) Many more commands
            o) data management: egen, input, label, etc
            o) graphics
            o) basic stats
    
    v0.3:
        o) Real varlists, with factors, interactions, etc
    
        o) Formats / data types

    v0.4:
        o) Loops + Macros

Write documentation
    o) man entries, vignettes, examples
    o) document the R expression format the parser emits
