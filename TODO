Roadmap to v0.1:
Immediate TODO:
    o) the lexer should format dates/times/datetimes and numbers into strings
       in a way that the R code can immediately convert
    o) grammar expansion: fully general varlists
        o) factor variable operators ("i.", "c.", "o.", "#"/"##", "ib."/"b."/"X.varname")
        o) :value_label_name
    o) next, infrastructural R functions
        o) weeding for each type of node
        o) AST walkers to construct unevaluated calls and eval them
    o) functions for the initial set of commands
    o) Stata-like output: how much is this worth imitating?

Write a test suite and test

Later functionality
    v0.2:
        o) A mechanism for the user to register an R function obeying the
           calling convention as a Stata command
        
        o) A batch processing mode
    
        o) Many more commands
            o) data management: egen, input, label, etc
            o) graphics
            o) basic stats
    
    v0.3:
        o) Loops + Macros
        o) time series support

Write documentation
    o) man entries, vignettes, examples
    o) document the R expression format the parser emits
