Roadmap to v0.1:

Immediate TODO:
    o) finish the grammar
        o) shift/reduce conflicts in the expression sections
        o) real varlists, with factors, interactions, etc
        o) incorporate most of the currently unused keyword tokens
        o) abbreviations for abbreviate-able keywords
    o) finish the actions for commands

Semantics:
    o) write up stubs for the R functions implementing Stata commands
    o) abbreviations for commands, varnames, other things that aren't
       hardcoded into the grammar
    o) Stata-like output: how much is it worth imitating that?

Write a test suite and test

Write documentation
    o) man entries, vignettes, examples
    o) document the R expression format the parser emits

* Edit the exports in 'NAMESPACE', and add necessary imports.
* Run R CMD build to build the package tarball.
* Run R CMD check to check the package tarball.

Later functionality
    A mechanism for registering an arbitrary R function obeying the
    calling convention as a Stata command
    
    Many more commands - egen, input, label
    Formats
    
    Graphics?

    Loops + Macros
