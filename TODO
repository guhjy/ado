Now:
  o) better error messages from check()
    o) test it with a few known valid and invalid commands afterward

  o) syntax for weird commands
    o) recode - define a varlist in the grammar and allow it as the LHS of an assignment
    o) collapse - just parse it as a varlist but interpret the "stats" differently; parens become optional
        o) if you want to use a stat as a varname, just give the target=varname form
    o) gsort - need an algorithm to turn a parse tree of vars, + and - into a list of two-element pairs
    o) ivregress - probably the same as with recode; the last expression_list member should be an
       assignment, optionally parenthesized, required to be parenthesized for non-ambiguity if LHS has
       more than one var

    o) lrtest
    o) test
    o) anova

    o) fill out their function signatures

  o) function and option args should be separable by ',' or ' '

  o) Macro substitution and compound double quotes
    o) the `=expr' syntax? can we just send this to R for evaluation as a string?

Backend:
  o) infrastructural R functions
    o) for prefix commands - quietly, noisily, capture, by, bysort, xi
    o) varlist_to_formula
    o) for operators - how many of these even need to exist?

  o) R functions for initial general commands

  o) Stata's "stored results"

  o) complete all the commands which now have stubs

Frontend:
  o) Loops: much harder, because of macros

===============================================================================
Systematic debugging:
  o) use testthat and travis
  o) write a unit test suite
  o) test, test, test...

Documentation:
  o) document package object and rstata()
  o) update README
  o) long vignette: comprehensive
  o) short vignette: summary + differences from Stata
  o) document the R expression format the parser emits

Misc:
  o) figure out the NAMESPACE and what you have to export
  o) Makevars and Makefile have to come from a configure script for
     portability - autoconf?

===============================================================================
Wishlist functionality:
  o) the way it stores ado command history is a godawful hack, probably
     also a race condition, and is Unix-specific

  o) A mechanism for the user to register an R function obeying the
     calling convention as a Stata command, persistently

  o) graphics
