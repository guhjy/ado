Roadmap to v0.1:
Immediate TODO:
    o) the parser should be a C++ class, not yyparse
    o) rewrite do_stata_parse to suit
    o) finish the actions for commands

Semantics:
    o) write up stubs for the R functions implementing Stata commands
    o) abbreviations for commands, varnames, other things that aren't
       hardcoded into the grammar
    o) Stata-like output: how much is this worth imitating?

Write a test suite and test

* Edit the exports in 'NAMESPACE', and add necessary imports.
* Run R CMD build to build the package tarball.
* Run R CMD check to check the package tarball.

Later functionality
    v0.2: Loops + Macros

    v0.3: Real varlists, with factors, interactions, etc

    v0.4:
        A mechanism for registering an arbitrary R function obeying the
        calling convention as a Stata command
    
        Many more commands - egen, input, label
    
        Formats / data types
    
        Graphics?

Write documentation
    o) man entries, vignettes, examples
    o) document the R expression format the parser emits
