Semantic analysis / code generation:
    o) code generation: construct unevaluated calls and expression objects
        o) name abbreviation

    o) something is wrong with condition passing out of the cmd_action callback

    o) functions for the initial set of commands
        o) printing info from embedded R command
    
Parser / lexer:
    o) parse by and xi and friends correctly
    o) cmd_seps
    o) why is it dumping core on bad input? error recovery + delete, probably. smart pointers?
    o) Macros, without loops
        o) just need to find a way to lex nested macros and recursively substitute
           their values from the symbol table
        o) "compound double quotes"

    o) Loops
        o) much harder, because of macros
    
Commands:
    o) Many more commands
        o) data management: egen, input, label, etc
        o) basic stats
        o) a few more macro manipulation commands
        
Debug:
    o) use testthat and travis
    o) write a unit test suite
    o) test, test, test...

Documentation:
    o) convert comments to use roxygen2
    o) man entries, vignettes, examples, README
    o) document the R expression format the parser emits
    o) better error messages from check()

Misc:
    o) Makevars and Makefile have to come from a configure script for
       portability - autoconf?

===============================================================================
Wishlist functionality:
    o) A mechanism for the user to register an R function obeying the
       calling convention as a Stata command - the "registry" package?
    
    o) time-series operations and grammar

    o) graphics

    o) very Stata-like output: unlikely to be worth imitating
