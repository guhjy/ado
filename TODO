Semantic analysis / code generation:
    o) semantic analysis and infrastructural R functions
        o) weeding for each type of node
        o) AST walkers to construct unevaluated calls and expression objects
            o) name abbreviation
        o) how much of the common weeding and walking can be encapsulated into
           superclass methods? use NextMethod
    
    o) functions for the initial set of commands
    
    o) Many more commands
        o) data management: egen, input, label, etc
        o) graphics
        o) basic stats
        o) a few more macro manipulation commands
        
Parser / lexer:
    o) the class information the parser is embedding in nodes isn't rich enough
    o) Macros, without loops
        o) not terribly hard - just need to find a way to lex nested macros and
           recursively substitute their values from the symbol table. the driver's
           callbacks make this fairly easy to implement
        o) "compound double quotes"

    o) Loops
        o) much harder, because of macros
    
Debug:
    o) use testthat and travis
    o) write a unit test suite
    o) test, test, test...

Documentation:
    o) convert comments to use roxygen2
    o) man entries, vignettes, examples, README
    o) document the R expression format the parser emits
    o) better error messages from weed()

Misc:
    o) Makevars and Makefile have to come from a configure script for
       portability - autoconf?

===============================================================================
Wishlist functionality:
    o) A mechanism for the user to register an R function obeying the
       calling convention as a Stata command - the "registry" package?
    
    o) time-series operations and grammar

    o) very Stata-like output: unlikely to be worth imitating
