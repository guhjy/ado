Title: An implementation of Stata's ado language for R
Description: An interpreter for Stata's ado language built on top of R.
  Loops, macros, data manipulation commands and statistics commands are all
  supported, as are multiple ways to embed R code and use R for writing ado-
  language commands. (The language this package implements has about the same
  relationship to Stata that various dialects of SQL have to each other.)
